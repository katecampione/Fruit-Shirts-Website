    <h2 >About</h2>
    <p>The Fruit Shirts are a Denver-based folk/rock duo consisting of Kate Campione and Kyle Iverson. They both sing, play guitar, and play the ukulele. Their first album, Capricorn Highway, was written and recorded in their home in Dingo, Australia. They worked at a gas station in the middle of nowhere and wrote music in their free time. Kate and Kyle have a unique way of writing music in that they generally drink a box of wine and write/record their songs in a day or two. Their inspiration comes from Gangs of Youth, Tigers Jaw, Pinegrove, and Brandi Carlile. They are currently working on another album to be dropped this Spring. Check out their favorite Tiny Desk Concert by Pinegrove where they frequently draw inspiration:
